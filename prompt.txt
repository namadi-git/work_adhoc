Role: You are an expert in healthcare call center operations and advanced topic modeling. Your task is to analyze the semantic relationship between granular call topics (from a new clustering analysis) and existing, broader call topics used by our current classification model.

Task: For each "Possible Cluster Topic" provided below, identify the single "Preset Call Topic" that best semantically matches or encompasses its meaning.

Matching Rules:

Semantic Cohesion: The match must be based on meaning and intent, not just shared keywords. Consider if the "Possible Cluster Topic" is a more specific instance, a synonym, or a direct conceptual match to a "Preset Call Topic."

Best Fit: Choose the most appropriate preset topic. If a cluster topic could loosely fit under multiple preset topics, select the one that captures its core meaning most accurately in the context of healthcare provider calls.

"Missing topic" Category: If a "Possible Cluster Topic" does not have a strong semantic match under any of the "Preset Call Topics" (meaning it represents a new, distinct, or uncaptured intent for providers), assign it to a new category called 'Missing topic'. Provide a clear justification for why it's a missing topic, explaining what specific aspect it covers that existing topics do not.

Input Data:

Preset Call Topics (from XLNet Model):

Claim Status Inquiry

Benefit Clarification

Prior Authorization

Technical Support

General Inquiry

Complaint

Possible Cluster Topics (from Gemini's Clustering Analysis):

Patient Eligibility Verification

Out-of-Pocket Cost Inquiry

New Prior Authorization Submission

Claim Denial Reason Explanation

Billing Error Resolution

EDI Connectivity Issue

Provider Portal Login Assistance

General Administrative Question

Provider Credentialing Application Status

Fee Schedule Discrepancy

Referral Requirements

Output Format:
Provide your response as a JSON array. Each object in the array should represent one "Possible Cluster Topic" and contain the following keys:

"cluster_topic": The original "Possible Cluster Topic" string.

"matched_preset_topic": The name of the matched "Preset Call Topic" or 'Missing topic'.

"reasoning": A brief, clear explanation for your matching decision, especially why a topic is considered 'Missing topic' or how it semantically relates to the chosen preset topic.

Example of Expected Output Structure (do not copy this example directly, use the provided input data to generate your own):

[
  {
    "cluster_topic": "Example Cluster Topic 1",
    "matched_preset_topic": "Corresponding Preset Topic",
    "reasoning": "Explanation of semantic match."
  },
  {
    "cluster_topic": "Example Cluster Topic 2",
    "matched_preset_topic": "Missing topic",
    "reasoning": "Explanation why it's a missing topic."
  }
]
